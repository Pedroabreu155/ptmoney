This project helped me to consolidate knowledge on React fundamentals like:

- Context
- Props
- Hooks

I learned about Styled Components and how to use props and components with CSS in Js.

I learned about Miragejs and how to simulate an API, it helps us to have a non-stopping development time when our backend team doesn't finished the current tasks

The tests was made by Rocketseat team, and the grade was gave by Rocketseat's platform!
